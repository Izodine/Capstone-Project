# Capstone-Project

This project was developed as the final project in the Android Developer Nanodegree program.

# What is iAssembly?

iAssembly is an x86 Simulator using NASM syntax as a basis. It currently supports basic instructions and operations. The purpose of iAssembly is to teach the basics of x86 assembly in an intuitive way. This is geared towards anyone who wants to learn conceptually how low level operations work, or how assembly works on a basic level. This can also serve as an intro to programming. The app right now is basically a skeleton, and I want to build it into a full learning app over time.

# What instructions are supported?

*MOV, AND, OR, XOR, ADD, SUB, MUL, NOP, INC, DEC

# What registers are available?

*EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, AX, BX, CX, DX

# What operand orders are supported?

*IMMEDIATE to REGISTER
*MEMORY to REGISTER
*REGISTER to REGISTER

# What will be added in the future?

*Functions, the stack, ESP, EIP, PUSH, POP, REGISTER to MEMORY operand support, and IMMEDIATE to MEMORY operand support.

# Building and running the app

All of the application's dependencies are handled by Gradle. The only thing that should have to be done to get it up and working is importing it into Android Studio and building the project.
